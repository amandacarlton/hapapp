#Preview 

This project pulls all of the bars in the Denver, CO area with happy hour specials. A user can create an account and have special features associated with each bar; including, access to yelp rating and neighborhood filtered info.  

Upon login a user can like or dislike a bar (which will be displayed on their login page), see where the bar is located through google maps, and even search for songs and add them to a desired playlist to be played on a specified date.
